The Stakeholder interview is a valuable step in understand the business and organization goals for any project. [原文地址][4]

#### A successful stakeholder interview should be able to get information as below:
* WHY – The reason behind product requirements and priorities.
* HOW – The superiority which the origination owns to make it successful.
* WHAT – The product vision from stakeholders.

#### Some tips for success:
* Note stakeholder responses to your questions rather than paraphrasing
Allow the interview to go off-script if necessary.
* Allowing your stakeholders to speak freely and to elaborate in the areas that are important to them. By doing this, you are more likely to discover information that you had not anticipated.
* Don’t downplay answers merely because they don’t fit in with your question list. You can follow up with other stakeholders to see if this same issue is important.
* Be sure to understand “Must-have” and “Just mentioning”

#### Below is the question list you may need to seek for answers:
1. Why are we doing this?
	1. Why our organization needs to complete this project?
	2. What do you hope it will accomplish for our organization?
	3. Why now?
2. What is the most critical goal of this project?
3. How would you describe success for this project? (customer satisfaction/organization growth/stay within budget/on-time delivery)
4. How will you monitor the results of this project? (data tracking/login rate/search engine results/media report/sales)
5. How would you describe your target customer? 
6. What does your customer care about?
7. How does the customer currently feel about our industry as a whole?
8. What do you need to know (What don’t you know) about your customer? 
9. What are some surprising insights you’ve gained before?
10. What concerns do you have about the process of designing this product?
11. What are the frustrations you’ve had towards design deliveries in the past?
12. What is the single most important message your customer should remember from this product?
13. What action should this product entice the user to take?
